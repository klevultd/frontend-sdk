# klevulistfilterstoreturn
      
Æ¬ **KlevuListFiltersToReturn**: `Object`

#### Type declaration

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `enabled` | `boolean` | Whether or not to return any filters with this query. This defaults to false so no filters are returned unless requested. |
| `exclude?` | `string`[] | This is the list of filter keys that you do not want Klevu Search to include in the response. If a filter is specified in both include and exclude lists, include will take precedence. |
| `include?` | `string`[] | This is the list of filter keys that you would like to retrieve as filters. A filter may also not be returned if there aren't enough applicable records in the result set. |
| `options` | { `limit?`: `number` ; `mincount?`: `number` ; `order`: [`KlevuFilterOrder`](enums/KlevuFilterOrder.md)  } | - |
| `options.limit?` | `number` | Specify the maximum number of options to be included per filter. |
| `options.mincount?` | `number` | If the parameter minCount is present with a positive number, only the options with an option count equal to or higher than the minCount are included. |
| `options.order` | [`KlevuFilterOrder`](enums/KlevuFilterOrder.md) | A value of 'FREQ' will sort options based on the number of records each option has in the result set. 'INDEX' will sort the options alphabetically. |
| `rangeFilterSettings?` | [`KlevuRangeFilterSettings`](klevurangefiltersettings.md)[] | When minMax is false, this setting allows you to retrieve range filters for use with numeric values such as price, so you can display bands of 0-99, 100-199, etc. or a price slider. By default all attributes submitted to Klevu are indexed as STRING attributes, which means they cannot be used as range filters. The product sale price field is the only exception to this rule, which is filtered using the key klevu_price. If you have explicitly requested and Klevu has approved that certain attributes be indexed as numerical attributes, you can also retrieve those as range filters. |
