## Enumeration members

### And

• **And** = `"AND"`

All of the exact words of a query must be found in a record for it to be
included in the results. No fuzziness or wildcards are included.

For example a search for "hooded jacket" will only return records which
contain the exact terms "hooded" AND "jacket".

#### Defined in

[models/KlevuTypeOfSearch.ts:64](https://github.com/klevultd/frontend-sdk/blob/1e22b7c/packages/klevu-core/src/models/KlevuTypeOfSearch.ts#L64)

___

### Default

• **Default** = `"DEFAULT"`

When this value is specified, Klevu will go through a number of attempts to
find matching records. The first type attempted is WILDCARD_AND. If there
aren't any results found, Klevu tries to find products with the FUZZY_AND
query type.

As long as no matches are found, Klevu will continue to fire different query
types in the following order:

WILDCARD_AND
FUZZY_AND
WILDCARD_OR
FUZZY_OR
Note that when a search term only contains a single word, or more than six
words, the 'OR' query types will be skipped.

[models/KlevuTypeOfSearch.ts:18](https://github.com/klevultd/frontend-sdk/blob/1e22b7c/packages/klevu-core/src/models/KlevuTypeOfSearch.ts#L18)

___

### FuzzyAnd

• **FuzzyAnd** = `"FUZZY_AND"`

This is the same as a WILDCARD_AND query, however a certain amount of
'fuzziness' is allowed to account for spelling mistakes.

For example, if the searched query contains spelling mistakes like "hooder
jakcet", Klevu will still be able to match any records containing the words
"hooded" AND "jacket".

#### Defined in

[models/KlevuTypeOfSearch.ts:37](https://github.com/klevultd/frontend-sdk/blob/1e22b7c/packages/klevu-core/src/models/KlevuTypeOfSearch.ts#L37)

___

### FuzzyOr

• **FuzzyOr** = `"FUZZY_OR"`

This is the same as a WILDCARD_OR query, however a certain amount of
'fuzziness' is allowed to account for spelling mistakes.

For example, if the searched query contains spelling mistakes like "hooder
jakcet", Klevu will still be able to match any records containing the words
"hooded" OR "jacket".

#### Defined in

[models/KlevuTypeOfSearch.ts:56](https://github.com/klevultd/frontend-sdk/blob/1e22b7c/packages/klevu-core/src/models/KlevuTypeOfSearch.ts#L56)

___

### Or

• **Or** = `"OR"`

At least one exact word of a query must be found in a record for it to be
included in a results. No fuzziness or wildcards are included.

For example a search for "hooded jacket" will only return records which
contain one of the exact terms "hooded" OR "jacket".

#### Defined in

[models/KlevuTypeOfSearch.ts:72](https://github.com/klevultd/frontend-sdk/blob/1e22b7c/packages/klevu-core/src/models/KlevuTypeOfSearch.ts#L72)

___

### WildcardAnd

• **WildcardAnd** = `"WILDCARD_AND"`

This is an 'AND' query so all words of the query must be found somewhere in a
record for it to be included in the results. The last word of the query will
have a wildcard suffix appended.

For example, if the searched query is "hooded jacket", this will become
"hooded jacket*", ie. Klevu will try to find records containing the word
"hooded" AND any words beginning with "jacket".

#### Defined in

[models/KlevuTypeOfSearch.ts:28](https://github.com/klevultd/frontend-sdk/blob/1e22b7c/packages/klevu-core/src/models/KlevuTypeOfSearch.ts#L28)

___

### WildcardOr

• **WildcardOr** = `"WILDCARD_OR"`

This is an 'OR' query so at least one of the words in the query must be found
somewhere in a record for it to be included in the results. The last word of
the query will have a wildcard suffix appended.

For example, if the searched query is "hooded jacket", this will become
"hooded jacket*", ie. Klevu will try to find records containing the word
"hooded" OR any words beginning with "jacket".
