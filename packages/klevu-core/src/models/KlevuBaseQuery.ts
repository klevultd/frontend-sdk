   * If you have already built up a profile of your customer and would like to

   * boost object within each record query.
   *
   * There are three ways the records can be boosted:
   *
   * filter conditions keywords or phrases IDs of specific records For example
   * let's say you have an online store with an area where customers can log in.
   *
   * From your stores purchase history, you know that one customer is
   * particularly interested in the brand 'KKE'.
   *
   * From your analytics data, you also know the same customer also looked at
   * the product detail page of the product with ID: '31366487375934' many
   * times.
   *
   * Finally, you have an area where customers can specify keywords of their
   * interests, and this customer wrote 'comfortable'.
   *
   * As a merchant with all of this information available, you can build up a
   * profile about this customer. The sample to the right shows how you would
   * convey this information to Klevu during a search.
   *

   * rules, please read this article on How [Personalisation
