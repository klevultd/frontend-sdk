## Atoms

In the context of Klevu Webcomponents, **Atoms** represent individual,
self-contained UI elements that can be used to build more complex components or
user interfaces. These atoms serve as the basic building blocks for creating a
cohesive and visually appealing design for your e-commerce website. Here are
some essential atom-level components:

- **Button Atom:** The Button atom provides a clickable element for user
  interactions. It can be customized to serve various purposes, such as
  triggering actions, submitting forms, or navigating to different pages.

- **Chip Atom:** The Chip atom is a small, informative component often used to
  display tags, categories, or labels. It offers a visually appealing way to
  present key information.

- **Badge Atom:** The Badge atom is typically used to highlight counts or
  status indicators. It can be applied to show the number of items in a
  shopping cart or indicate the availability of products.

- **Accordion Atom:** The Accordion atom allows you to create collapsible
  sections of content. Users can expand or collapse these sections to access
  additional information while conserving screen space.

- **Dropdown Atom:** The Dropdown atom offers a selection menu, typically used
  for choosing from a list of options or categories. It enhances user
  interactivity and navigation.

- **Popup Atom:** The Popup atom is a versatile element for displaying
  additional information, alerts, or interactive content in a separate overlay.
  It helps keep the main user interface uncluttered.

- **Modal Atom:** Similar to the Popup atom, the Modal atom is used for
  displaying content in an overlay. Modals often contain more complex forms,
  interactive elements, or dialogs that require user attention.

- **Rating Atom:** The Rating atom provides a visual representation of user
  ratings or reviews. It's commonly used in product listings to showcase
  customer feedback.

- **TextField Atom:** The TextField atom is an input element that allows users
  to enter text or data. It's used for various purposes, such as login forms,
  search boxes, and data entry.

- **Typography Atom:** The Typography atom defines text styles, including
  fonts, sizes, and styles (e.g., headings, paragraphs, and labels).
  Consistent typography enhances the readability and aesthetics of your
  website.

These atom-level components offer granular control over the building blocks of
your user interface. By combining and customizing these atoms, you can create a
cohesive and visually appealing design that aligns with your brand and provides
an exceptional user experience.
