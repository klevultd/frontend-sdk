# Listening to Klevu Component Events

Klevu Components offer a rich set of events that you can listen to in order to respond to user interactions and
customize the behavior of your e-commerce website. This documentation page provides an overview of the standard way to
listen to events emitted by Klevu Components. Below is a listing of events from various components along with the
typings of the `CustomEvent` detail property.

## Event Listening

To listen to events emitted by Klevu Components, you can use the standard event listening approach in JavaScript.
Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
// Select the element that contains the Klevu Component
const componentElement = document.querySelector("#your-component-id")

// Add an event listener to the component element
componentElement.addEventListener("event-name", (event) => {
  // Access event details from the event object
  const eventData = event.detail
  // Your custom logic based on the event
})
```

## Listening to Events with React

If you are using React to build your e-commerce website and want to listen to events emitted by Klevu Components, you can achieve this by using React component properties directly.

First, make sure you have imported the React components from `@klevu/ui-react`. These components follow PascalCase naming conventions.

Here's an example of how to listen to a Klevu component event in a React component:

```javascript
import React from "react"
import { KlevuFacet, KlevuSearchField } from "@klevu/ui-react"

function YourComponent() {
  // Define a custom event handler function
  const handleEvent = (event) => {
    // Access event details from the event object
    const eventData = event.detail
    // Your custom logic based on the event
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Example of listening to an event on the Facet component */}
      <KlevuFacet onKlevuFilterSelectionUpdate={handleEvent} />

      {/* Example of listening to an event on the SearchField component */}
      <KlevuSearchField onKlevuSearchClick={handleEvent} />
    </div>
  )
}

export default YourComponent
```

Please refer to the specific component's documentation for more details on each event and its usage. Listening to these
events allows you to create dynamic and interactive experiences for your users, enhancing the overall functionality of
your e-commerce website.
