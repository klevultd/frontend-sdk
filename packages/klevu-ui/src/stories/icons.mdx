# Icons

All icons used are from [Material Design Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons). Some components take
icon name as string input. Please use the icon name as it is in the Material Design Icons library.

`klevu-icon` component will automatically inject the required font into the page. You can also directly inject the font
in your head tag to avoid waiting for JavaScript to load and download the font.

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Symbols+Rounded:opsz,wght,FILL,GRAD@20,600,0,0"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

## To use icons

You can use these icons in your templates like this:

```html
<klevu-icon name="settings"></klevu-icon>
```

Changing the size of the icon is possible by setting the `font-size` CSS property on the icon element. Color can be changed by setting the `color` CSS property.

```html
<klevu-icon name="settings" style="font-size: 2rem"></klevu-icon>
```

## Replace Material Design icons with your own

It is possible to replace any icon with your own by replacing default icon settings in `klevu-init` settings.
When using SVG `font-size` and `color` attributes will be assigned as size and fill to image. Best way to get correct color is to use `currentColor` as fill color.

```html
<klevu-init>
  <klevu-icon name="settings"></klevu-icon>
</klevu-init>
<script>
  document.querySelector("klevu-init").settings.icons = {
    // define your icon by the name keys
    settings: "https://example.com/my-custom-icon.svg",
  }
</script>
```
