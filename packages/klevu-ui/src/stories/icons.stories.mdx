# Icons

All icons used are from [Material Design Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons). Some components take
icon name as string input. Please use the icon name as it is in the Material Design Icons library.

`klevu-init` component will automatically inject the required font into the page. You can also directly inject the font
in your head tag to avoid waiting for JavaScript to load and download the font.

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Symbols+Rounded:opsz,wght,FILL,GRAD@20,600,0,0"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
<style id="klevu-icons">
  ::part(material-icon) {
    font-family: "Material Symbols Rounded";
    font-variation-settings: "FILL" 0, "wght" 600, "GRAD" 0, "opsz" 20;
  }
</style>
```

As you can see you have the ability to modify `FILL`, `wght`, `GRAD` and `opsz` to change the
appearance of the icons.

## To use icons

You can use these icons in your templates like this:

```html
<span part="material-icon">name_of_the_icon</span>
```

Just rememeber that you have to use [exportparts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/exportparts) html attribute if you are using your own custom elements.
