# Using Klevu Components and structure of this documentation

Klevu components are built with properties and attributes. Properties and attributes are the data that determine how a
component looks or behaves. Attributes are simple string or numerical data that can be passed with HTML attribute to the
component. Properties are far more intricate and involve items such as arrays, objects, and functions. The way they're
assigned to the component differs depending on the framework employed; if you were using plain vanilla JS for example,
you'd first have to retrieve a reference of the HTML element before assigning its property. When it comes to frameworks
like React, Vue Angular or Lit thoughâ€”it's an entirely different story! Both attributes and properties can be
effortlessly included in your template with ease!

In this documenation most of the examples are in plain VanillaJS. This reason properties are not visible in them. In some
of the examples we also provide React examples.

Problem with properties in this documentation is that they won't be displayed in automatically generated code examples
that you can click open under the stories.

## VanillaJS example

Here is a example how to create `klevu-init` component in HTML. And then getting reference to said element and setting
some properties on it.

```html
<klevu-init api-key="klevu-165829460115715456" url="https://eucs30v2.ksearchnet.com/cs/v2/search"></klevu-init>
```

And in your Javascript file:

```js
const myComponent = document.querySelector("klevu-init")
myComponent.settings = {
  onProductClick: function onProductClick(product, event) {
    alert("Product clicked!")
  },
  generateProductUrl: function generateProductUrl(product) {
    return "myurl.com/" + product.id
  },
  renderPrice: function renderPrice(amount, currency) {
    return amount + " " + currency
  },
}
```

## React example

We provide a ready made library `@klevu/ui-react` for React that changes Klevu Web Components to React Components.
It allows a much easier interface for use as a component.

Biggest change is that you need to import components from `@klevu/ui-react` and component names are in PascalCase.

```jsx
import { KlevuInit } from "@klevu/ui-react"

const App = () => {
  return (
    <KlevuInit
      apiKey="klevu-165829460115715456"
      url="https://eucs30v2.ksearchnet.com/cs/v2/search"
      settings={{
        onProductClick: function onProductClick(product, event) {
          alert("Product clicked!")
        },
        generateProductUrl: function generateProductUrl(product) {
          return "myurl.com/" + product.id
        },
        renderPrice: function renderPrice(amount, currency) {
          return amount + " " + currency
        },
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

# Events, Slots, Parts and CSS Properties

When using Klevu components you can also attach to events and modify functionality and theme with slots, parts and CSS
properties. Events refer to how a user interacts with a component - when they click on something or hover over it. Slots
represent elements of a component that will be filled with content. Parts are the different elements of a component,
such as a header or footer that can be modified with specific CSS. Lastly, CSS properties allow developers to change the
styling of components without having to rewrite HTML code.

Here is a example how these settings are displayed in the documentation:

<figure>
  <img src="/checkbox_args_example.jpg" alt="" />
</figure>
