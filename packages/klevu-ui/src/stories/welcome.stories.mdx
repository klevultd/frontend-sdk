## Before using the components

Creating a Klevu account is your first step to success. With our Shopify, Magento, Big Commerce,
Sales Force, or Commerce Tools connectors or the indexing API, you can make sure that all relevant data has
been indexed and brought into our service. Get started on this journey [here](https://box.klevu.com/merchant/signup).

After this you can start using these components on your data.

## Example

Here is a example of `klevu-quicksearch` component (try searching for clothing items):

<Canvas>
  <Story height="700px" id="apps-quicksearch--quicksearch" />
</Canvas>
