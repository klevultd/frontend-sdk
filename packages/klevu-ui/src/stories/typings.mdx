# Typings

By default importing the package Klevu packages will give you all the typings you need.
For React and Vue projects it will be just question of adding the `@klevu/ui-react` or `@klevu/ui-vue` packages to your project.

When using plain JavaScript there are JSON configuration that adds vscode intellisense for the Klevu UI components.
For this there are file located in `node_modules/@klevu/ui/dist/docs/vscode-data.json`.

To use these typings add following in your `.vscode/settings.json` file:

```json
{
  ... other settings
  "html.customData": [
    "./node_modules/@klevu/ui/dist/docs/vscode-data.json"
  ]
}
```
