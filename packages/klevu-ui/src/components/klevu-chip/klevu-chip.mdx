## Description of example code

### HTML Markup

Begin by creating a container with the class `chiplist` and add `klevu-chip` elements inside it. These chips can have various attributes, including `selected` and `removable`, to control their behavior.

### JavaScript Interaction

The JavaScript code adds interactivity to the chips. It selects all `klevu-chip` elements within the `.chiplist` container and adds event listeners to handle clicks and chip removal.

- **Click Event**: When a chip is clicked, it toggles the `selected` attribute for all chips to `false` and sets the `selected` attribute of the clicked chip to `true`. This allows you to visually highlight the selected chip.

- **klevuChipRemove Event**: When the "remove" button on a chip is clicked, it removes the chip from the list. It also prevents click events from propagating further.

### Custom CSS Styling

To style the chip list, custom CSS styles are applied. The `.chiplist` container is set to display chips in a flex layout with proper spacing, and cursor styles are adjusted for interactivity.

By following this example, you can create and customize interactive chip lists with specific behaviors using the Klevu `klevu-chip` component.
