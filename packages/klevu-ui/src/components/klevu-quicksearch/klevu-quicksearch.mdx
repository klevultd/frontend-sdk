## Customizing Klevu Quicksearch Component

The provided code example showcases the customization of the `klevu-quicksearch` component using JavaScript and CSS. It demonstrates how to dynamically populate and style different sections of the component.

1. **Component Setup:**
   The HTML includes a `klevu-quicksearch` component with the class `customized`. Three slots are utilized: `search-products`, `trending-products`, and `last-clicked-products`.

2. **JavaScript Customization:**
   The JavaScript code listens for the `"klevuData"` event on `klevu-quicksearch.customized`. Upon this event, it clears the content of the product slots and fills them with custom data.

   - For each product, `klevu-product` elements are created and populated with custom HTML content like product name and designer. These elements are appended to the relevant slots.

3. **Custom CSS Styling:**
   Custom CSS styles are applied to the product display. Products are enclosed in `div.product` elements with borders, margins, and font sizes adjusted. The `klevu-product` element is set to display as a block.

This example offers insights into dynamic population and styling of the `klevu-quicksearch` component, enhancing its customization capabilities.
