Typically you will want to load the data through the `FilterManager` class. This class will handle the data and the state of the filters.

```jsx
import React from "react"
import { KlevuFacet } from "@klevu/ui-react"
import { FilterManager } from "@klevu/core"

const manager = new FilterManager()

// Load the manager options with KlevuFetch or other method.

const MyComp = () => {
  return <KlevuFacetList manager={manager} />
}
```

<Controls />

## Example with less data
