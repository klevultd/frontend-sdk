## Set amount of items per row

It is possible to set a custom number of columns with itemsPerRow parameter.
In this example we also change the width of the product with CSS variable.

<Canvas of={Stories.ProductGridWithItemsPerRow} />

```jsx
<klevu-product-grid items-per-row="5">renderProducts()</klevu-product-grid>
```
