# Customizing Klevu Product Query Component

This code example demonstrates the customization of the `klevu-product-query`
component within a `klevu-init` wrapper. The `klevu-product-query` component is
designed for asking questions about a product, and this example customizes its
appearance and behavior.

## HTML Markup

Inside the `klevu-init` element, a `klevu-product-query` component is defined.
It has various attributes and slots for customization:

- `button-text`: Sets the text for the query button.
- `popup-title`: Specifies the title for the query popup.
- `fine-print`: Provides additional information to be displayed.
- `pqa-widget-id`: A unique identifier for the widget.
- `url`: The URL of the product page.

Within the component, there's a custom icon (`klevu-icon`) placed before the
button text, and a popup (`klevu-popup`) that appears when a question mark icon
is clicked.

## Slotted content

Within the klevu-product-query component, slotted content is used to allow
developers to insert additional elements or content into specific slots of the
component. In the provided code example, there are two notable uses of slotted
content:

### 1. Icon Slot (before-button-text):

A custom icon is slotted before the button text inside the `klevu-product-query`
component. This allows you to insert an icon of your choice, enhancing the
visual appeal of the query button. The icon is styled with specific CSS
properties, such as font size, positioning, and margin, to achieve the desired
appearance.

### 2. Popup Slot (after-fineprint):

Another slotted component is used within the `klevu-product-query` component to
create a popup that appears when a question mark icon is clicked.

- This slotted content contains two sub-elements:
  - #fineprint-popup-origin: A question mark icon displayed inline. When
    clicked, it triggers the display of the popup.
  - #fineprint-popup: The content of the popup, which provides additional
    information and terms of use.
- The slotted content is styled to ensure the question mark icon is visually
  distinct and the popup has a specific appearance, with a black background and
  white text.

By utilizing slotted content, you have the flexibility to customize the
klevu-product-query component's appearance and behavior to suit your
application's design and user experience requirements. You can replace or modify
these slotted elements to achieve the desired visual and functional effects.

## CSS Styling

Custom CSS styles are applied to customize the appearance of the components:

- The `klevu-product-query` component has its button styled with specific
  border, background, and text colors.
- The `klevu-product-query` component's button loses its border when focused.
- The question mark icon (`#fineprint-popup-origin`) is styled with a black
  background, white text, and a circular shape.
- The popup content (`#fineprint-popup`) is styled with a black background and
  white text.

This customization provides a distinct look and feel to the
`klevu-product-query` component and its associated popup.
