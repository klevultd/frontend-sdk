# Customizing Klevu Merchandising Component - A Step-by-Step Guide

In this educational guide, we will walk through a code example that demonstrates
how to customize the Klevu Merchandising component to create a personalized
shopping experience on your e-commerce website.

## Understanding the Code

Let's break down the code step by step:

```html
<klevu-merchandising class="customized" category="women" category-title="Women's clothing">
  <div slot="content"></div>
  <div slot="facets">
    <h3>Facets</h3>
    <p>This is custom sidebar content for facets</p>
    <klevu-facet-list></klevu-facet-list>
  </div>
</klevu-merchandising>
```

### 1. Setting up the Klevu Merchandising Component

- We start by creating a Klevu Merchandising component with the class
  "customized."

- We set various properties like `category`, `category-title`, `limit`,
  `show-ratings`, and `show-ratings-count` using attributes.

- Inside the `<klevu-merchandising>` element, we define two slots: "content" and
  "facets." Slots allow us to specify where child elements should be placed
  within the component.

- In the "facets" slot, we include custom content, such as an `<h3>` heading and
  a paragraph, to create a custom sidebar for facets.

- We also include a `<klevu-facet-list>` element within the "facets" slot. This
  element will be used to display facet-related information.

### 2. JavaScript Logic

```javascript
<script>
  const merch = document.querySelector("klevu-merchandising.customized")
  const contentSlot = document.querySelector("klevu-merchandising.customized div[slot='content']")
  const gridElement = document.createElement("klevu-grid")
  contentSlot.appendChild(gridElement)

  const facetListElement = document.querySelector("klevu-merchandising.customized klevu-facet-list")

  merch.addEventListener("klevuData", (event) => {
    facetListElement.manager = event.detail.manager
    gridElement.innerHTML = ""
    for (const record of event.detail.records) {
      const p = document.createElement("klevu-product")
      p.product = record
      p.isWrapper = true
      p.innerHTML = '<img src="' + record.imageUrl + '" />'

      gridElement.appendChild(p)
    }
  })
</script>
```

### 3. JavaScript Logic for Customization

- In the JavaScript section, we begin by selecting the Klevu Merchandising
  component with the class "customized" using `document.querySelector`. We store
  this element in the `merch` variable.

- We also select the "content" slot within the Klevu Merchandising component
  using `document.querySelector` and store it in the `contentSlot` variable.

- Next, we create a new `<klevu-grid>` element using `document.createElement`.
  This grid will be used to display products and is appended to the "content"
  slot.

- We select the `<klevu-facet-list>` element within the "facets" slot and store
  it in the `facetListElement` variable.

- We add an event listener to the Klevu Merchandising component, listening for
  the "klevuData" event. When this event is triggered, the event handler
  function is executed.

- Inside the event handler, we set the `facetListElement.manager` property to
  the `event.detail.manager`. This step establishes a connection between the
  facet list and the data manager provided by the event.

- We clear the `gridElement` by setting its `innerHTML` to an empty string.

- Using a loop, we iterate through the `event.detail.records`, which represent
  product records. For each record, we create a new `<klevu-product>` element
  (`p`) and customize it by setting its `product` property, `isWrapper`
  property, and inner HTML to display an image.

- Finally, we append the customized product element (`p`) to the `gridElement`.

### 4. Custom CSS Styling

```css
<style>
  klevu-merchandising.customized img {
    width: 120px;
  }
</style>
```

### 5. Custom CSS Styling

- In this section, we apply custom CSS styling to the `<klevu-merchandising>`
  component. Specifically, we target `<img>` elements within the "customized"
  instance of the Klevu Merchandising component and set their width to 120
  pixels.

## Conclusion

By following the steps outlined in this code example, you can customize the
Klevu Merchandising component to create a tailored shopping experience for your
users. This includes setting up properties, creating custom content, handling
data events, and applying CSS styling to achieve your desired look and
functionality.
