## Customizing Klevu Merchandising Component

The provided code example demonstrates how to customize the
`klevu-merchandising` component using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML attributes. The
customization involves dynamic population and styling of the merchandising
display.

1. **Component Configuration:** The HTML markup includes a `klevu-merchandising`
   component with the class `customized`. Attributes like `category`,
   `category-title`, and `limit` are configured for the component. A `content`
   slot is designated for displaying the merchandising content.

2. **JavaScript Customization:** The JavaScript code targets the
   `klevu-merchandising.customized` element and the `content` slot within it. It
   listens for the `"data"` event on the merchandising component. Upon data
   reception, it clears the content of the `content` slot and populates it with
   a `klevu-grid` element.

   - For each record in the event data, a `klevu-product` element is created.
     The `product` attribute of the element is set to the record, and it's
     marked as a wrapper. The inner HTML of the element contains an image tag
     displaying the product's image.

3. **Custom CSS Styling:** The provided custom CSS styles target
   `klevu-merchandising.customized` elements and adjust the width of images
   displayed within them.

This example highlights how to achieve dynamic product rendering and layout
customization within the `klevu-merchandising` component.
